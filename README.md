### Project Description
[ Prakrithi is a sustainable initiative dedicated to reducing plastic waste and promoting eco-conscious living. Our project focuses on providing high-quality, biodegradable, and reusable utensils and packaging solutions that are both environmentally friendly and practical for everyday use]

### The Problem statement
[increasing use of plastic and We call plastic utensils and packaging "disposable," but they don‚Äôt actually disappear‚Äîthey end up in landfills, oceans, and even our food chain]

### The Solution
